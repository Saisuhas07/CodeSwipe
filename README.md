# Codeswipe

A networking/discovering platform purely for programmers.

## Why

We have platforms like LinkedIn where you can go and discover the
profiles of new people following the same interests, jobs etc.
But the overall vibe of the platform is too formal to make/find
collaborators or even friends that you can have conversations with.

There is no dedicated platform that aims only at programmers. We have 
X (formerly twitter), Reddit etc, but it is overwhelming with the amount 
of content you can see.

## How

- A platform where you can only see one person at a time 
- Left/Right swipe mechanism to "match" (connect would be a better word) with a person
- No photos of people, only code
- Very simple and straightforward prompts
    - tech stack 
    - favorite project
    - what they like working on etc
    etc 

## Challenges faced

- The overall notion of this application follows that of a dating 
app even though it tries not to be one
- The program wont survive without users actively using it, but you can't get 
user experience without existing users hence creating a recursive loop of issues.

## Good to have features

- A chat room where you can talk with with the person you "matched" with
- Sync with GitHub to auto fetch information
